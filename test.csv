i dont recommend anyone downloadingbuying this app im trying to figure out how i can unsubscribe at this point but cant figure,0
why do you need a subscription needed for a typing test app its just a typing test app i knew i should have listened to the,0
this says free but you cant use it unless you pay for a subscription that is the opposite of free this is entirely misleading,0
couldnt uninstall this fast enough it is titled as a free app but the start page requires payment cant even try it out once,0
i guess i should have read the ratings and comments and scrolled down to see the warning about it not being quite free it,1
downloaded it wish i hadnt couldnt even try it without a subscription so turned off by their underhanded approach i would,0
i downloaded what i thought was a free app for use in my classroom only to discover when i opened said app that id have to,1
it appears to do a nice job but it doesnt work on some sentences the biggest problem however is that the trial period is,1
i used only three trial sentences so i could teach kids how to diagram and then im expected to buy a subscription cmonit,0
bought the in app purchase for one month and thank god it was only  because it just kept telling me it couldnt diagram any,1
amazing app the monthly charge of  is well worth it as a mom helping my son this app was perfect to type in any sentence,2
its not free it will let you diagram one sentence before you pay but i couldnt even do that it just said cant diagram this,0
can only diagram very basic sentence structures i put in a sentence with a relative clause and the app said can not diagram,0
i have been using this tool in my classrooms for several years now and always introduce it to my students so that they can,1
it helps put the sentence into contrast and shows all possible ways of diagramming a sentence download the app and try the,1
first i have to say that this app works is in very useful and helped my with diagramming i have been seeing many reviews,2
allow the description may say offers payments it makes you pay there is no way around it do not be fooled by the free because,1
this app starts out working great and after a few times of use it stops working saying that it cannot diagram the sentence,0
this app not only diagramed my words but also corrected my spelling and gave me options to choose from i personally love,2
i love this app yes you have to pay for it but if you need a program thatll diagram sentences out for you theres none better,2
i have used this for several years now at first it was free but then they added a minimal charge the program is entirely,1
this is a very important application there is nothing else like it in the world it creates sentence diagrams that clearly,2
yes its free only for one day but they do say that it requires a subscription in the description from my one day of use i,1

click in the black space outside the subscription window or wait a few seconds and you can type your sentence and hit the,1
as an english and grammar teacher i use this app regularly it is well worth the very small expense it helps students visualize,2
i like the app but it does diagram a few sentences long and it said that it was free but the next day i opened it i couldnt,1
completely dishonest claims to be free but upon start up the only thing you are allowed to do is buy a subscription no trial,0
microsoft store needs to decide who theyre working for the app builders or the app buyers this is a perfect example i tried,0
unfortunately english is very complicated and sentence diagramming is just not something that can easily effectively be done,0
the program has some flaws like not recognizing some words like whatever seemed to give it problems but make the word what,0
yeeaaaahhhh no its not free i shouldve checked the reviews but i quickly saw it is not free it looked really good so i was,1
the other reviews are correct this is not free and offers no easily accessible free trial however by clicking around on the,1

the app will only diagram basic sentences i would not mind paying for the app if it had value beyond the first grade other,1
while it does a fair job of diagramming the diagrammed words are not labeled with adjective adverb etc i bought the year,1
to bad because this app would have been helpful not paying for it though when there are other websites for diagramming that,0
for those who want to know before installing the price is month or  for the year usd it struggles with long sentences but,1
put a sentence in and it said it could not diagram it maybe that means that i have to buy a subscription maybe it just means,0
when it works it is great it has issues launching and running at times however if you have a teacher that requires diagraming,1
worst app ever do not download worst app ever why cans it be free if you market an app as free live up to the expectations,0
the author of this application has stated multiple times that the program is not free it is a subscription service however,1
youre free to install this app however it only workseven to trywith a paid subscription luckily i am also free to uninstall,1
so you do have to pay to use and for one month it is reasonably priced equivalent to what you pay for a really good app from,1
i used to use the application as a free website in the win  or mac world it was really cool if not   accurate nor flawless,2
ive seen all the negative reviews complaining about the freebutnotfree aspect of this app this should definitely be made,0
free app is what is advertised but must pay for subscription before you can open it i would have paid for a good app as a,0
not a good buy difficult to navigate from screen to screen limited instructions cannot diagram compoundcomplex sentences,0
i loved this diagrammer but this app is dishonest if it costs money to use it say so this business of you can download it,0
the microsoft store says the program is free it is not free you can download it for free but once it is downloaded you cannot,0
the free review time is just a few minutes the app is not intuitive the registration options does not work this could be,0
this app is free for a very brief time and then you have to subscribe to use it however the app itself wont let you buy a,1
it is installed incorrectly i think and now it will not let me download any graphic when i try this program takes over and,0
i wish the trial had been longer even just a day or something i also wish that the description had been more clear on how,1
it started out ok but it wont diagram the sentences i want to see here is an example it took  manhours to field test the,1
it could be a very useful app but the fact that it gives you like  minutes to use it is idiotic i personally think that should,0
i read the other reviews and i knew that i would have to pay for it it was only  and i am a taking a graduate linguistics,1
there is a cost associated  month or year purchase it sounds like a great app one i am willing to pay for however it wont,2
this app is fantastic the cost of the app is  per year but the price is extremely low for the value which you will receive,2
i downloaded and opened it but it tries to force you into a one month or one year subscription when i try to hit either to,1
i ended up buying a month subscription for one assignment the app works perfectly on desktop but my only problem is i have,1
this app is totally useless it does not display its menu as anything but glitches and jumbled images and what you can click,0
who approves some of these crap apps this thing doesnt even have a ui that can be read buttons are black clicking doesnt,0

beta was just a waste of time joining and so i uninstalled and reinstalled the game like it told me to for leaving beta and,0
this app is such a waste i signed up for the beta version of minecraft a long a time ago but now i cant even unsubscribe,0
microsoft for some brilliant genius reason decided to use this stupidly pointless and nonfunctioning app for beta sign ups,0
how can a company the size of microsoft be so bad at releasing software on their own platform its astounding the level of,0
i joined minecraft beta a little bit ago using the legacy insider hub app now its completely discontinued and i have to use,0
just another garbage piece of software microsoft will want you to install for literally one purpose ever only to have it,0
i joined minecraft beta and i cant leave now i watched every tutorial but when i try and leave the app just crashes dont,1
unbelievable to have an app that cannot handle thousands of users when you know theres going to be a flood of users that,0
crashed less than a minute after closed beta signups started for pso new genesis preventing me and almost all of my alliance,0
this app fails the moment a few thousand people try to register for a closed beta absolutely useless this is why everyone,0
awful i used this program to register for the psongs beta and now at the time of its sign up window the app refuses to connect,0
worst thing ive ever bought thought i could get  on bedrock i had the delete minecrafy and lost my netherite beacon world,0
i would not recommend anyone do this all it has done is triple the number of console updates and piss me off absolute garbage,0
this program is great for those who dont mind coming across the occasional bug and reporting it this is the whole point of,2
i had to verify it was me multiple times then it told me i needed a new app and then i had to verify myself more times even,1
i dont understand i just want for minecraft rtx can u let me do it even when i did last time it was stuck for minecraft beta,0
i cant even get in fun fact i am actually  yes my name is childish but i made this account a long time ago so i am going,1
my only experience with this app is it crashing and being unusable because microsoft invited its own users to effectively,0
after the time i just did before while another symptom fell over the ridge so i plus then for the agreement about and around,1
i downloaded this so i could uninstall bedrock beta for minecraft but whenever i would leave the stupid app would crash and,0
this app is the reason for hundreds of thousands of secondhand xbox one ss and xs being bricked by their inability to update,0
this is very good app i dont have any problems if this app shows you squidward this mean you dont signed into preview if,2
cant  uninstall it thanks now i cant play minecraft ever again i looked at the tutorials and everything but it wont work,0
why does this need to exist why cant i opt into and out of minecraft beta without this app why cant microsoft just cut the,0
it was pretty cool i did get to see all the beta minecraft features but some people were saying that they couldnt get out,2
love my xbox app but the current preview version that you get when you join the insider program is broken freezes on startup,0
first of all even after all ive tried i cant get servers to work on minecraft dont buy this is for scared parents and not,0
when i launch xbox insider hub it gives me this message were having trouble accessing your account please use the guide to,1
thanks microsoft for upload this app in microsoft store i really need this app to join minecraft windows  beta to play with,2
edit updated  it works what doesnt work is their poor phrasing within this app on how to enable advanced download features,0
the xbox app on windows is bad enough without half baked features why is an icon in the app just pushing me to this app why,0
i had an  year insider track record that i had to delete because the only way to get rid of the minecraft beta was to unenroll,0
oh my god oh my god oh my god best f u  k l n app evvvvver the second i opened it i camed  out of ,2
thought this would be a cool place to offer feedback but its just a bunch of onequestion surveys and even buggier versions,0
ieterallly trashhhhh i cant sign out of my account because i have another account and it also wont let me install minecraft,0
so i really dont know whats up anymore with this app a while ago it was barebones and worked you got in betas and you got,0
it was a good addition as it allowed me to play certain betas and find smaller games that was until having it installed caused,2
whoever the non binary morons are that left negative reviews and therefore bombed this app are of the lowest  in iqs on earth,0
i wanted to join the minecraft beta but i have to be  and im  ahhjh i hate this stupid piece of garbage ahhhh your brains,0
the single most pointless app why wouldnt you make this apart of the xbox app and on top of the the insider list isnt even,0
i cant even download this on pc error code x just another problem on a long list of reasons why i stay away from pc when,0
i downloaded this app because its the only way to disable xbox insider when your xbox screams at you twice a week that it,0
this way i said the bug will leave the preview it closes automatically again and it still closes itself as there is no preview,0
being an insider is bad for your apps and bad for pc health dont do it unless you like paying for more bugs and more risks,0
bro this is literally sooo trash it wont even let me leave minecraft beta now i gotta make another acc and then i need to,0
pretty obvious its bogus just by the way they talk in the app thanks for your joining or some junk i didnt fall for it dont,0
this app assumes people only have consoles and dont play on a pc all questions in activities section are aimed at console,0
i can only give it four stars because it seems something got screwed up you cant download the app on a windows  device only,0
i wish we had this when i was a kid theres a lot of advertisements but im not going to complain when its free they need to,1
flips to previous channels without warning constantly cant hold the signal and reverts to the pluto logo if you like staring,1
installed fine and seems to work but you cant sign it it requires you to have a bearer token and no information on how to,1
this is the best tv app i have ever had all of my shows in an organized format favorite made possible works on all devices,2
i love me some free tv i can watch on my phone kindle or just about anything there are channels for everyone from kids to,2
it is insane that you need to navigate with the mouse to change channels cant imagine why they dont allow you to do it with,0
overall its a very good streaming services pros it has good content like a bunch of movie channels classic shows news and,2
the live channel is always in the wayyou can not move it so ypou can see what else is in the background wth can i not close,0
i thought it was gonna be nothing but the asylum and other generic knockoff stuff like some people told me but it isnt for,0
great variety of new and old shows both streaming and on demand the only reason i gave it  stars instead of  is the repetitive,2
im rating this app  stars because you can only get this app on xbox i would like to watch pluto tv from windows  but you,1
i love watching this old house  ask this old hose  on this app and a lot of shows such as tv classics dont get me wrong i,2
they put some good stuff on here and if you dont have cable you will find this is a great place to save some dough i have,2
up to now have only had this app on my phone and being a  yr old vietnam vet with only use of left hand found the content,1
closed captions stuck in russian i am from usa and dont know how to change that would be great if someone from the usa would,0
the app is ok at best it frequently ends an episode in the middle and only shows the episode run time as that i end up having,2
love the app its clean simple and great options i hope while keeping its simplicity and clean interface it continues to be,2
i though all windows apps were trash until i discovered this excellent polish does what it says and is super clean i only,1

a great white noise app thats stylish and easy to use on tablets and doesnt have any playback issues when the device falls,2
super clean interface great selection of ambient sounds no gimmicks ads or pressure to purchase anything my only request,2
this app is refreshingly easy to use some sound apps include too many features and have weird settings for mixing sounds,1
many audio drivers used by various pc manufacturers have horrible bluetooth usability with ambie i am able to keep bluetooth,0
clean wellmade ui and nice selection of sounds im looking for an app mainly for brown noise and unfortunately the brown noise,1
does everything i need good assortment of sounds and ability to mix sounds no intrusive features marketing or data gathering,2

would be nice to have the ability of saving some sound groups like presets everything else is fine love the ui design is,2
i have a surface pro x i love ambie and it runs great but after using it for a few min the screen goes white even tho its,2
downloaded this for whitebrown noise but only half of the noises worked unfortunately none of the noises i actually wanted,0
i thought i was going to love this app based on the interface and the mixing function but the soundsat least the white noise,0
my ideal sound generator would  fix the white noise engine it produces a dropout every few minutes which is distracting so,0
slow laggy uwp app window resizing is slow everything is huge on the screen sliders everything just feels stupid and giant,0
this money is non refundable and if the app wont work with your lap top like mine then youre out of luck microsoft has been,0
in just a few seconds after installing i knew this utility was exactly what i needed to make screen color and brightness,1
this program serves its function well with lots of variable adjustments but is it worth the dollars not when you can do the,1
has a nice number of customizations but it seems to turn on automatically whenever i open my laptop even if i stipulate that,1
this app is very good for controlling screen brightness and to filter blue light the timer is a nice feature to remind you,2
only concern i have is it turning off at pm every night thrn is hard or impossible to get working again otherwise it works,0
i still like this blue light filter but it would be nice to get more updates having locationbased sunrise and sunset time,1
does what it says it would do and gives you great controls over your display my eyes feel a million times better wish i had,2
great tool for adjusting monitor brightness contrast and color it easy to use the app provided me more refinement capabilities,2

work just fine reduce eye strain cause ips monitors the only downside it reduce view angles when change color temp under,1
it is a different approach and i love it there are not many period trackers with humor and voicelol also the design is nice,2
dr know keeps improving their software and our cardiology practice keeps getting better and better along with it thank you,2

this is a great keepass app that works really well with windows hello this alone has made saving passwords much easier and,2
this is a good product to use to keep your passwords and be able to share the data file through the cloud to other devices,2
ive used it for eight months its almost perfect the only thing i think its missing to be really useful in smartphones is,2
the app works pretty well when you have just a few items but as the number of items grows it sometimes will not allow you,2
works almost exactly like keepass gave it  stars because it locked up on me once and lost a password always save new passwords,0

works as expected and works well i much prefer this outoftheway behavior this app has over the win version vpn connections,2
the pulse vpn profile does not allow the user to connect to server without valid certificate it returns server certificate,1
pros extends windows vpn instead of giving yet another app for desktop cons would be easier to have a shortcut to start vpn,1
i had so many problems with the old standalone pulse secure desktop client since switching to this all of those problems,0
love the idea of having this baked into the windows ui via the universal app unfortunately that method still has some serious,1

after opening the app and selecting a file or folder if it doesnt crash when i select the shredding method it crashes when,1
on windows  after selecting multiple files it abruptly closes but if you then reopen and do the same it functions as desired,1
you do it all shredding existing files and wiping free space too which is the only way to shred deleted files it took me,0
ive owned this app for years as im hyper aware of data security ive never had any issues using it and recommend to anyone,2
ran the tool and it did not wipe the files it created to rewrite over the empty space so what i ended up doing was searching,0
bottom line delete items in recycle bin nope no link for that you have to individually select files garbage want to wipe,0
works great you whiners that gave this low rating are obvious morons that dont know how to use a computer nothing wrong with,0
ran the program and my free space went from  gb to zero apparently the system sets up temp files to fill all the empty space,0

i use onenote periodically for large projects i can go for six months or more without using it but then use it intensively,1

this feels like a downgrade from the previous version no radical menu to switch quickly between tools no drag and drop for,0
still no fixes very disappointed why have a spot for feedback if you very obviously arent listening to the people that use,0
it suppose to be an upgrade from windows  to  however this app is downgrading itself  less functionality you could not adjust,0

my brother lives in the uk he is blind but this does not hinder him from using a laptop iphone or other devices teamviewer,1
controlling a computer from my phone sounds like such a lousy idea  but teamviewer has actually made it relatively painless,0
more confusing and frustrating to endusers than the one you can download from their site i dont understand why you would,0
virtually useless for me i bought a windows s laptop and downloaded this app so i can access her laptop when she is away,0
like most of it but do not like the feature that once the app is updated the lower version has to be updated on both parties,1
this is an excellent app for logging into my remote computer at home but the desktop version has upgraded to version  and,2
if you want to buy a license beware there is all kinds of fine print intended to rip one off even with a  paid subscription,0

please update the requirements of this app to not require touch i used the old teamviewer touch on many nontouch devices,1

i support my family computers across the country and love being able to jump on whenever they need me to help out this client,2
i have been using the traditional teamviewer for many years but this one is much more simpler and saves me a ton of computing,2
the app lacks so many of the features present in the full desktop application its ridiculous you seriously need to work on,0
i love how you can see everything on your computer screen and you phone what i dont like is how it tale forever to download,0
looks slick as a windows  app but since it cant remember teamviewers awkward passwords might as well stick with the full,0
you can drag files from explorer into dropbox awesome but not from dropbox into explorer not good if this were an option,0
dropbox makes it extraordinarily easy to share files across platforms  pc imac ipad and phones also great for sharing large,2
